## Doks child theme

Doks is now also available as a [child theme](https://github.com/h-enk/doks-child-theme), making it super easy to update when a new Doks version is released. Just run `npm update` — that's all. Of course you can still use Doks as a starter, if that fits your use case better.

## Syntax highlighting


```json
// Default Doks style
[
  {
    "title": "apples",
    "count": [12000, 20000],
    "description": {"text": "...", "sensitive": false}
  },
  {
    "title": "oranges",
    "count": [17500, null],
    "description": {"text": "...", "sensitive": false}
  }
]
```

Doks now comes with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as the default syntax highlighter. Use the default Doks style, or use one of the other available [higlight.js themes](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).

Note that you can still use [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) — the Hugo default — if you like.

## Math typesetting

Doks now supports math typesetting by making use of the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library. It is switched off per default. Activate it by setting `kaTex = true` in `./config/_default/params.toml`.
