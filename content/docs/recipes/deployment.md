## Deploy to Netlify

See also: [Netlify]({{< ref "netlify" >}}).

### Netlify Drop

Netlify Drop lets you deploy a website with simply drag & drop.

- Run `npm run build` in your project folder.
- This will generate a `public` folder where your generated site is located.
- Visit [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) and drop the `public` folder there.

## Deploy to other hosts

See the Hugo Docs: [Hosting & Deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/).
