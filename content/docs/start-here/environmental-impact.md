Estimates for the climate impact of the web industry range from between [2%](https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet/) and [4% of global carbon emissions](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think), roughly equivalent to the emissions of the airline industry. There are many complex factors in calculating the ecological impact of a website, but this guide includes a few tips for reducing the environmental footprint of your docs site.

The good news is, choosing Doks is a great start. According to the Website Carbon Calculator, this site is [cleaner than 97% of web pages tested](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/doks-netlify-app/), producing 0.03g of COâ‚‚ per page visit.
